# Waku - Idea Board ðŸ’¡

Below is a compilation of innovative project ideas curated by the Waku community. These ideas cover a wide range of use cases and applications, showcasing the versatility and potential of the Waku protocol for decentralized, privacy preserving communication and beyond.

<br>

> Note : Numerous traditional chat applications have already harnessed Waku's capabilities. To truly innovate and avoid re-inventing the wheel, we encourage hackers to explore untapped possibilities and unique projects that integrate Waku in other novel ways apart from chat.

<br>

<details>
<summary><b>Polling/Voting</b></summary>
<br>
Enable polling or voting off-chain, vote results could be aggregated and submitted on-chain in one transaction.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Marketplace (buy/sell goods or NFTs, ride-share, etc)</b></summary>
<br>
Send offer and negotiate off-chain. Highest bids sent over Waku could be binding and submitted to the contract by the seller.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Collaborative Editing</b></summary>
<br>
Use Waku for live collaborative editing of documents, saved versions of documents can then be stored on decentralized storage.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Multiplayer Games</b></summary>
<br>
Waku can be used to communicate game moves off-chain, the final state (e.g., winner) can then be submitted on-chain for a reward (e.g., NFT mint or winner takes stake).
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>IoT Systems</b></summary>
<br>
Enable devices to communicate or report small data payloads in a decentralized manner.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Decentralized Wallet Address Ownership Verification</b></summary>
<br>
Use Waku to enable communication between dApps and wallets, such as signature or zero-knowledge proof exchange to prove identity.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Notifications Centre</b></summary>
<br>
Use an SDK (probably go-waku?) to build a general Notification protocol over Waku and a mobile app allowing you to replace centralized Push Notifications provided by Apple/Google.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>API Generator</b></summary>
<br>
Build a tool to generate a Waku protocol (and code) from a provided OpenAPI specification.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Leader Election Protocol</b></summary>
<br>
Leader election can be viewed as a soft consensus mechanism. Implement something like [RAFT](https://raft.github.io/) as a library on top of Waku (using any SDK), so that users can easily plug it into their applications.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Reputation Systems</b></summary>
<br>
Using Waku to create reputation systems that can provide a reputation score for a particular identity (wallets, smart contracts etc.,)
</details>

<summary><b>Medical Systems for Remote Diagnosis</b></summary>
<br>
Tracking medical data from sensors and IoT devices and sending them to a doctor for remote diagnosis
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Decentralized Smart Grid System</b></summary>
<br>
Decentralized smart grid system optimizes energy distribution and consumption by leveraging Waku to efficiently manage energy resources across a network of users and devices
</details>
